The repository contains four files:
1. working_the_model_on_minidataset.ipynb
2. working_on_full_dataset_untrained.ipynb
3. vocab.txt 
4. vocab_dummy.txt

1st File is basically training the model on a dummy dataset cause the original dataset is too large and couldn't be trained.
2nd File has the implementation of the model on the complete dataset but is still trained only till vocabulary building.
3rd File has the vocabulary that was built by the full dataset code file.
4th File has the vocabulary that was built by the dummy dataset code,
